# YetiMon
 
YetiMon is an open source add-on for your Goal Zero Yeti X series that monitors the voltage level of the battery and switches to an auxilary charging source such as AC mains once the capacity of the Yeti has depleted past a threshold.  

This is useful in applications where you want to use only solar power but want to automatically switch to another power such in situations where there has not been suficient sun to maintain your Yeti.

## 3D Printing
Here are some of the files used to 3D print the casing.  

The "chassis" of YetiMon is just the factory cover that came with the Yeti X and is normally removed when you install a Yeti Link. What I did was use this as the chassis for YetiMon and 3D printed a cover that I made (link to that coming soon).  

Additionally, I 3D printed a case for the oled display. I got this design off of Thingiverse. Hopefully the link still exist at the time of you reading this. If not, let me know and I will design one. [Here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2176764) is the link.
