# YetiMon
 
YetiMon is an open source add-on for your Goal Zero Yeti X series that monitors the voltage level of the battery and switches to an auxilary charging source such as AC mains once the capacity of the Yeti has depleted past a threshold.  

This is useful in applications where you want to use only solar power but want to automatically switch to another power such in situations where there has not been suficient sun to maintain your Yeti.
